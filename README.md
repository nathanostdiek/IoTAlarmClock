# Final Project for CSE222

An IoT alarm clock that can be controlled from a computer (Website) or phone (PhoneGap). I created this using a Particle Photon Kit. 

## Features
* Clock - It displays the current day of the week, date, and time on the screen.
* Alarm - A user can set an alarm from his/her device that will sound a speaker and display a "Get Up" message on the screen.
* Weather Information - By inputting a zip code, the current weather information will be displayed by clicking a button on the alarm. 
* Lights - By connecting smart lights (Proof-of-Concept feature), a user can turn the lights on and off from the alarm clock. An auto-on feature can be enabled that slowly fades the lights on when the alarm goes off.
* Sleep Calculator - Based on the set alarm, a user can input the wanted number of hours of sleep and the time for he/she to go to bed will be displayed.
