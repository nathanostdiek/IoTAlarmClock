I am behind on work this week. After traveling all weekend and having tests coming up, this project did not receive the time
I had planned to work on it. It is ok because I did not plan to work on it much over Thanksgiving Break, but now I will have to
and that is not a huge deal. I made some progression on the UI and was able to connect the the UI to the OLED I set up.

I am able to communicate through hardware and UI, so now all I need to do is add more functions that are needed for the other features.
Again, didn't run into many major problems yet.

Need to prioritize finishing the UI and implementing cloud functions over break. I will have time to do this, so I am not worried.
