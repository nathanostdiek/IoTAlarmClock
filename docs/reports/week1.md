After realizing the amount of other work that had deadlines much sooner than this project, they took priority this week.

I wanted to finish the UI, but I got behind and only got most of the hardware and files set up first. I began constructing
the UI towards the end of this week and did not quite finish it on time.

I need to finish the UI and begin implementing the cloud functions to continue making steady progress on this project.

I didn't come across any problems yet.
