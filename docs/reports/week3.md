As the due date quickly approaches, I have implemented a few more features from last time.

The weather feature works with a zip code and can display on UI but not OLED yet. I have been working on formatting the time to make it look good on OLED and have an updated clock to use. I need to figure how to set up the speaker and how to check when the alarm has reached the time to go off. Might change it to seconds so it makes it easier to test. When it goes off, I want to display a screen on the UI and OLED to show relevant info.

I am prioritizing, the light and speaker features in the next day. Then I will try to add some transportation information like we did in studio one time, but that feature may not get implemented due to the lack of value I think it adds. I don't think it is easy to switch the different trains you want to take easily. Made add a link to the bus pages instead.

I am in a decent spot to get it all done on time. I just need to be efficient and work hard.
