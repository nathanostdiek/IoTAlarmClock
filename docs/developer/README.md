This is an alarm clock created through a photon in order to implement certain features.
It currently has five main features:
  1. A updating clock and date shown on an OLED that displays current time
  2. Set Alarm feature that allows user to set alarm and will be displayed on screen
  3. Set Weather feature that allows user to input a zipcode and data will be displayed on OLED when weather button is clicked.
  4. When the alarm goes off, a buzzer will sound and users also have the ability to have a light (bedroom light) be faded on. They can turn the light off with a button on the alarm clock.
  5. A user can calculate what time they need to go to bed in order to get X hours of sleep based on the alarm set.

The Alarm Clock hardware includes three buttons (turn off alarm, weather display, and light turn off), an OLED display (clock), a speaker, and one light bulb. There are diagrams of the circuit located in this folder.

Modifications that could improve the product include:
  1. Adding a light sensor that will sound an alarm when a certain level of light is detected.
  2. Add a snooze button that resets the alarm and will go off again after 5 minutes.
  3. Add another page to the UI that displays the weather for the next day so the user can plan ahead.
