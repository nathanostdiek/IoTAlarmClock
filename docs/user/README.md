Welcome to your new alarm clock! Here are a few tips on how to get started.

This alarm clock has an app that will help you fully use the alarm clock.

Once you create an account and register the alarm clock with your account, you will be able to set alarms, access the weather, and automatically turn on your lights upon waking up.

The app has three pages once signed in:
  1. Controls page
    - This is where you can set the alarm and whether you want your lights to auto turn on. Once the alarm is inputted and checkbox is selected (signaling you want the alarm to go off at the time), it will be displayed on the screen of the alarm clock.
    - You will need to register your lights for your bedroom before turning on the auto lights on. These lights will fade on when the alarm goes off to more effective wake you up and get you out of bed.

  2. Feature SetUp
    - This is the page where you register your lights and input a zip code for the weather. Make sure to click submit after inputting the values. The weather can be accessed by clicking the weather button on the clock. This is mainly implemented to improve efficiency when getting ready. You won't have to go to your phone and check the weather. Staying off your phone in the morning will improve your time getting ready.

  3. Night time
    - This page will preform a calculation for you. After inputting an alarm and then how long you would like to sleep for, it will show what time you need to go to sleep. This makes planning for bed much easier and will keep you on a healthy sleep schedule.

Thanks for using this device and contact me if you have any questions.
